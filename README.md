## Usage
Go to a location, then, when everyone is ready, run the command `/function batleroyale:startgame`. The border's center will be where you are when you start the game. Each border shrink is separated by 2 minutes, the first one being used by the border shrinking. A game can last up to 30 minutes, or even more, depending on how long it takes for the remaining players to finish fighting on the final stage. The game will automatically end when there is 1 player remaining. **Before you use the datapack, please read the Licensing section.**
